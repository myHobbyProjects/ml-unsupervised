README
This README provides instruction on how to run the Jupiter notebooks for this project.

1. There are two Jupiter notebook files, unsupervised_learning.ipynb and unsupervised_example2.ipynb corresponding to two example of datasets that we would be working on.

2. Both of these notebooks use SKLEARN library for ML methods and utilities.

4. matplotlib pilot is used extensively to plot the graphs.

5. Dataset for classifier_1 is obtained from SKLEARN API load_breast_cancer(). Documentation of the API can be found here:
https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.load_breast_cancer.html

6. Dataset for unsupervised_example2.ipynb is downloaded locally and must be present in the same directory as the source itself. 
   Documentation and more information of the dataset can be found from the Kaggle project below:
https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci

7. You will need the following packages to execute the project.
  - sklearn
  - pandas
  - matplotlib
  - numpy
  - keras
  - tensorflow
